## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories
As someone who struggles with mental health, having a place to find additional resources is a major help when I am feeling overwhelmed.

As a friend of someone who lives with mental health issues, I want to easil nagivate to resources which means I can help my friend in a time of need.

As someone with a challenging job, being able to remind myself about stress navigation for myself and colleagues is a huge help to take time out from work and deadlines.

### User Goals
[x] A user seeks accessible, beginner friendly information on mental health
[x] Section on how to recognise common issues (with mental health)
[x] Section on how to manage stress
[x] Presented in a supportive and organised layout

### Site Owner Goals
[x] Create a welcoming webpage that provides mental health information using a clean and suppoertive design
[x] A focus on using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create a calming and well organised user experience.

### Potential Features
[-] Hero section with Positive messaging: A Bootstrap Jumbotron with an encouraging message about mental health
- This first Criteria was not exactly possible to meet with the use of a jumbotron, as Bootstrap had updated to v5.3, and taken the jumbotron out of use due to other ways the look can be acheived.

[x] Using calming colour scheme &
[x] Simple background image

## Design

### Colour Scheme
Colour selection plays a key role in any design process However, knowing this nature of this project, the needs of the user had a greater role, as it may impact their well-being.

Art work also played a role, as my goal was to make the user feel calmed and welcomed when the page was first accessed.

with plenty of research and discussions the use of [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and [image colour picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) I was able to find soft colours which I feel best represented mental health.

### Main Palette
- blue: #51c7eb (cards)
- light green: #c1ee9a (buttons)
- grey: #232b2b (text)
- dark green: #5cba64 (button hover)
- light blue: #abdbe3 (background)
